	<h2 class="lora-700 h2 mt-8 mb-2">Data We Collect</h2>
	<p>
		We collect automatically generated display names (e.g., "Alice#1234") to identify players within
		game rooms. These display names are temporary and are deleted upon disconnection from our
		service.
	</p>
	<p>
		To improve your experience and reduce unnecessary network requests, we also temporarily store
		information about game rooms you create in your browser's session storage. This data includes
		the room ID, name, and the creator's display name. This information is automatically deleted
		when you close the browser tab.
	</p>

	<h2 class="lora-700 h2 mt-8 mb-2">How We Use Your Data</h2>
	<p>
		The display names are used solely for the purpose of facilitating gameplay and identifying
		participants within game sessions. We do not use them for tracking, advertising, or any other
		purpose.
	</p>

	<h2 class="lora-700 h2 mt-8 mb-2">Data Retention</h2>
	<p>
		Display names and associated game session data are ephemeral and are deleted from our systems
		shortly after your disconnection or the closure of a game room.
	</p>

	<h2 class="lora-700 h2 mt-8 mb-2">Your Rights</h2>
	<p>
		Under GDPR, you have rights regarding your personal data, including the right to access,
		rectify, or erase your data. Given the ephemeral nature of the data we collect, these rights are
		primarily exercised by disconnecting from the service.
